So as soon as I started to use Entity Framework code first to manage the database I knew it wasn''t going to work. Having said that I still need a way to manage the creation and updating of the database. This is going to be very fluid initially as a) I''m still using SQL Server and b) things change a lot during the initial phases of the app. To manage the migrations of the SQL I''m using Runy Active::Record migrations, and to manage the data I''m using a sql script.
</p>
<p>
A migration looks like this:
<pre class="brush: ruby">
class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration

  def self.up
    create_table :posts do |t|
      t.column :title, :string, :null => false
      t.column :blogPost, :text, :null => false
      t.column :posted, :datetime, :null => false
      t.column :edited, :datetime, :null => true
    end    
  end

  
  def self.down    
    drop_table :posts
  end
end
</pre>
with an up and a down method. I have a rake task:
<pre class="brush: ruby">
require ''active_record''
require ''yaml''
require ''logger''

task :default => :migrate

desc "Migrate the database through scripts in db/migrate. Target specific version with VERSION=x"
task :migrate => :environment do
  ActiveRecord::Migrator.migrate(''db/migrate'', ENV["VERSION"] ? ENV["VERSION"].to_i : nil )
end

task :environment do
  @config = YAML::load(File.open(''database.yml''))
  @logger = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), ''database.log'')

  ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber.colorize_logging=false
  @environment = ENV["RAILS_ENV"] || "development"
  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(@config[@environment])
  ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(File.open(@logger, ''a''))
end
</pre>
that runs the migrations, this is similar to the Rails Rake script but simpler.
</p>
<p>
I still have issues with data, I need to be able to backup and restore the database across versions and across environments. I have a staging environment and I will need to bring data back from my production environment to there. That needs to be added to the todo list.

    end    
  end

  
  def self.down    
    drop_table :users  
    drop_table :blogs  
    drop_table :users_blogs  
    drop_table :posts  
    drop_table :comments  
  end
end
</pre>
This may yet change but it''s an initial stab. Notice that I''m using ''_'' in the column names. I chose to do this for a couple of reasons, 1) it''s the Rails way and I may yet a Rails version of this, and 2) as this is a learning exercise I wanted to see how code-first entity framework would handle this.
</p>
<p>
[Some of] the corresponding classes for the above tables look like this
<pre class="brush :csharp">
public class Blog
{
    public virtual int Id { get; private set; }
    [Required]
    public virtual string Title { get; private set; }
    [Required]
    public virtual string Description { get; private set; }
    [Required]
    public virtual string Nickname { get; private set; }

    public virtual ICollection&lt;Post> Posts { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey("user_id")]
    public virtual ICollection&lt;User> Users { get; set; }
}
</pre>
<pre class="brush :csharp">
public class Post
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string Title { get; private set; }
    [Required]
    [MaxLength(int.MaxValue)]
    public string BlogPost { get; private set; }
    [Required]
    public DateTime Posted { get; private set; }
    public DateTime? Edited { get; private set; }

    public virtual Blog Blog{ get; set; }
}
</pre>
So Blog has a 1:n relationship to Post (notice there''s no foreign key relation ship defined in the SQL, again this is the Rails way!) and to use this I want code that said, get all the blog posts for a blog whose nickname is ''foo''
 That required a couple of more steps.
</p>
<p>
The first thing that needed doing was the routes needed changing.
<pre class="brush :csharp">
public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
{
    // ...
    routes.MapRoute(
        "Posts-Default",
        "{nickname}/{action}",
        new { controller = "Post", action = "Index" }
    );

    // ...
}
</pre>
This says that the first parameter after the root is the nickname, there''s a discussion to be had here for the default value for the ''nickname''. The way it will work currently is that if an arbitrary nickname is entered then there is no error, just an empty list of posts to be returned.
</p>
<p>
This nickname is passed on to the controller, so:
<pre class="brush :csharp">
public ActionResult Index(string nickname)
{
    IList&lt;Post> blogs = _blogPostRepository.GetBlogPosts(nickname);
</pre>
The nickname is passed as the first parameter to the Index method and is used to get the posts for this blog 
</p>
<p>
The final step then is to update the repository to only get the posts for this blog.
<pre class="brush :csharp">
public IList&lt;Post> GetBlogPosts(string nickname)
{
    return (from f in Entities
        orderby f.Posted descending 
        where f.Blog.Nickname == nickname
        select f)
        .ToList();                
}
</pre>
This is a trivial change, I''m using the Post''s, Blog relationship to get only Posts for this Blog. This works, but the first thing I wondered was what the SQL looked like. Running the SQL Server Profiler you can see the session and the generated SQL
<pre class="brush :sql">
exec sp_executesql N''SELECT 
[Project1].[Id] AS [Id], 
[Project1].[Title] AS [Title], 
[Project1].[BlogPost] AS [BlogPost], 
[Project1].[Posted] AS [Posted], 
[Project1].[Edited] AS [Edited], 
[Project1].[Blog_Id] AS [Blog_Id]
FROM ( SELECT 
	[Extent1].[Id] AS [Id], 
	[Extent1].[Title] AS [Title], 
	[Extent1].[BlogPost] AS [BlogPost], 
	[Extent1].[Posted] AS [Posted], 
	[Extent1].[Edited] AS [Edited], 
	[Extent1].[Blog_Id] AS [Blog_Id]
	FROM  [dbo].[Posts] AS [Extent1]
	INNER JOIN [dbo].[Blogs] AS [Extent2] ON [Extent1].[Blog_Id] = [Extent2].[Id]
	WHERE [Extent2].[Nickname] = @p__linq__0
)  AS [Project1]
ORDER BY [Project1].[Posted] DESC'',N''@p__linq__0 nvarchar(4000)'',@p__linq__0=N''kevin''
</pre>
Which is more or less what you would expect!'

  ('Use of the repository pattern'
   ,'<p>
Writing data access code involves choices, which database, do I use an ORM?, do I use data access patterns?, if so, which one(s)? For this blog I''m currently using SQL Server, although as I''ve said I''d like to try out a NoSQL database. I''m also using Entity Framework (currently CTP 5 of EF code first). As for data access patterns ''repository'' seems to be the flavour of the month and that''s what I''m using. Using repository allows me to separate the use of the data access layer from the implementation of the access. In this case I have EF as the implementation but the users of the implmentation, the controllers simply code against interfaces.
</p>
<p>
The patterns is based around a single interface and implementation and then specific interfaces for the repositories that I am using (see <a href=''http://rocksolidknowledge.com/ScreenCasts.mvc''>Andy''s screencast for a great overview</a>. The basic interface looks like this:
<pre class="brush: csharp">
public interface IRepository&lt;T> : IDisposable
{
    IQueryable&lt;T> Entities { get; }
    T New();
    void Add(T entity);
    void Create(T entity);
    void Delete(T entity);
    void Save();
}
</pre>
This generic interface gives all repositories those methods, in a given implementation you can use those methods directly, or more likely provide your own API over the top of this abstraction. For example I have an IBlogPostRepository that looks like this:
<pre class="brush: csharp">
public interface IBlogPostRepository : IRepository&lt;Post>
{
    Post GetBlogPost(int id);
    IList&lt;Post> GetBlogPosts(string nickname);
}
</pre>
This lets users of the interface use specific methods
</p>
<p>
As to implementation, again there is a base class
<pre class="brush: csharp">
public abstract class BaseEfRepository&lt;T> : IRepository&lt;T> where T : class
{
    private readonly IDbSet&lt;T> _dbSet;
    private readonly DbContext _dataDbContext;

    protected BaseEfRepository(DbContext dataDbContext)
    {
        _dataDbContext = dataDbContext;
        _dbSet = dataDbContext.Set&lt;T>();
    }

    public IQueryable&lt;T> Entities
    {
        get { return _dbSet; }
    }

    public T New()
    {
        return _dbSet.Create();
    }

    public void Add(T entity)
    {
        _dbSet.Attach(entity);
    }

    public void Create(T entity)
    {
        _dbSet.Add(entity);
    }

    public void Delete(T entity)
    {
        _dbSet.Remove(entity);
    }

    public void Save()
    {
        _dataDbContext.SaveChanges();
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _dataDbContext.Dispose();
    }
}
</pre>
This is Entity Framework specific, notice it is using DbContext and DbSet which are part of EF code first rather than the moer common ObjectContext and ObjectSet. Each repository has it''s own DbCOntext implementation that provides the layer between the model and the database. The BlogPost DbContext looks like this:
<pre class="brush: csharp">
public class BlogPostDbContext : DbContext
{
    public BlogPostDbContext(string connectionString)
        : base(connectionString){}

    public DbSet&lt;Post> Posts { get; set; } 
}
</pre>
This simply takes a connection string and gets the base class to make a connection to the database. It also contains a DbSet which by convention maps to that table in the database. This class is used in the base repository implementation. For example that the Entities method uses the DbSet to get its data.
</p>
<p>
Finally there''s the repository implementation for each entity, the BlogPost implementation looks like this:
<pre class="brush: csharp">
public class BlogPostPostRepository : BaseEfRepository&lt;Post>, IBlogPostRepository
{
    public BlogPostPostRepository(string connectionString)
        : base(new BlogPostDbContext(connectionString))
    {
    }

    public Post GetBlogPost(int id)
    {
        var b = (from e in Entities
                    where e.Id == id
                    select e).FirstOrDefault();
        return b;
    }

    public IList&lt;Post> GetBlogPosts(string nickname)
    {

        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(nickname))
            return (from f in Entities
                    orderby f.Posted descending
                    select f)
                .ToList();

        return (from f in Entities
                orderby f.Posted descending
                where f.Blog.Nickname == nickname
                select f)
            .ToList();
    }
}
</pre>
This relies on the underlying abstraction being able to return something that I can run LINQ queries against but does not rely on EF at all.
</p>
<p>
I use these interfaces in the controllers. These are injected using an IoC container, more on that later.
