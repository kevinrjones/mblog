  ('Why this Blog?'
   ,'Several things came together at the same time. I wanted to start blogging again. My current blog engine is written in Java (Blojsom) and though very good, I don''t really do Java anymore so wanted to move off it. I did a presentation at <a href="www.devweek.com">DevWeek</a> last week and it seem to go down pretty well.  I need to spend more time with MVC.    <p>Given all that it seemed to make sense for me to put that together into a simple blog engine. And it is simple   <p>Multi user: not yet - but I will design it that way</p>    <p>Fancy editors: not yet, but they will be planned in</p>    <p>Extensible: let''s not get too far ahead of ourselves</p>    <p>Javascript/Ajax: yep, this is part of the plan</p>    <p>Wiki markup, plain text markup: all part of the future</p></p>    <p>   I''m going to use MVC (3 as of the writing) and EF 4.1. I''m going to start code first, not because I think we should    be building databases this way but becasue I havn''t used it before.    I want to use one of the NoSQL databases, because a) I''ve never used them and b) it seems like a natural fit    for a document centric system (we''ll see)    I want to use the publish and deploy tools in VS 2010, partly to see if they are any good and also because I haven''t    used them before (I can see a theme here)    I''m probably going to put this up on github and open source it, not because I think other people will use it but yes,     and because I haven''t done that before!    </p>'

   ,'<p>So, the first real post about the site (with screenshot!) I''m using code-first initially, although I know I''ll be moving away from that. This means I need models to create the database tables and to map to those tables, I''ll have more to say about models and view models soon. My first model is a <code>Post</code> that looks like this</p><pre  class="brush: csharp">    public class Post    {        public int Id { get; set; }        [Required]        public string Title { get; set; }        [Required]        [MaxLength(int.MaxValue)]        public string BlogPost { get; set; }        [Required]        public DateTime Posted { get; set; }        public DateTime? Edited { get; set; }    }</pre><p>What happens when entity framework tries to create a database from this is (roughly) this. It takes the Id property as the primary key (convention over configuration) All the other fields it also uses convention for, which I override with the attributes. So the reference types get created as nullable (the <pre>[Required]</pre> makes them non nullable. The strings get given a max length of 128, the <pre>[MaxLength]</pre> attribute overrides that. Making the Edited property a <pre>Nullable<DateTime></pre> makes that nullable. And off we go!</p>'

   ,'<p>So the ''walking skeleton'' is in place. What is a ''Walking Skeleton'', it''s the bare bones of an application that you need in place to help you move forward. If I was writing this using a pure TDD then I would have started with a test project, written a test for a <code>Post</code> class, then written the class (even though this class is anaemic). Then added a test project for my controller, written some tests and then started the controller. But come on, this is boring. Not just that, it''s counter productive. As developers we want to see forward progress, hence the walking skeleton. There''s a great description <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Walking+skeleton">here</a>.</p><p>Next step is testing and thinking about multi-user before I add an editor.</p>'
